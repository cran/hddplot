biasedPlots	Demonstrates the biased plots that result from F-statistic
  based feature selection with data where there are known groupings, 
  followed by calculation and plotting of discriminant function scores.
  [The 'accuracies' are also biased; use \code{defectiveCVdisc()} to 
  demonstrate the effect]
CVscoreplot	Demonstrates the methodology used by \code{cvscores()} to 
  obtain scores (plotted using \code{scoreplot()}) that, because derived
  from the scores for the successive 'test' sets at the successive steps
  of the cross-validation, minimize bias.
